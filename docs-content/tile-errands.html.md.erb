Lifecycle errands are BOSH errands (scripts) that run at the beginning and end of an installed product's availability time. Product teams create errands as part of a product package, and a product can only run errands it includes. 
For more information about BOSH errands, see [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/), 
and for more information about errands in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/customizing/managing_errands.html).

Products can have two kinds of errands. [Post-deploy errands](#post-deploy) run after a product installs but before Ops Manager displays makes it available for use. [Pre-delete errands](#pre-delete) run after an operator chooses to delete a product, but before Ops Manager finishes removing it from use.

To save deployment time, operators can set [errand run rules](#run-rules) that dictate whether or not errands run. Tile authors can [set defaults](./product-template-reference.html#top-level) for these run rules.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: As of Ops Manager v1.10.0, errands set to the <strong>When Changed</strong> rule do not always run when the tile has relevant changes. Instead of using <strong>When Changed</strong>, Pivotal recommends that tile developers leave the default run rule for errands as <strong>On</strong> and let operators use <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/customizing/managing_errands.html#changes-view">one-time rules</a> to turn errands off and save deploy time.</p>

##<a id='post-deploy'></a>Post-Deploy Errands

Post-deploy errands run after a product installs, but before Ops Manager makes it available for use.

Typical post-install errands include smoke or acceptance tests, database initialization or database migration, and service broker registration.

Post-deploy errands run by default. An operator can prevent a post-deploy errand from running by setting its [run rule](#run-rules) to **Off** under **Pending Changes** in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard or on the product tile's **Settings** tab **Errands** pane, before installing the product.

For example, Redis has a **Broker Registrar** post-deploy errand that the Elastic Runtime tile uses to register its service broker with the Cloud Controller and publish its service plans.

If an operator chooses **Off** in the drop-down menu for Elastic Runtime's **Broker Registrar** errand before installation, Elastic Runtime's service broker is not registered with the Cloud Controller and its service plans are not made public.

##<a id='pre-delete'></a>Pre-Delete Errands

Pre-delete errands run after an operator chooses to delete a product, but before Ops Manager actually finishes deleting it.

Typical pre-delete errands include clean up of application artifacts and service
broker de-registration. For example, Pivotal MySQL has a **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete errand that:

* Purges the service offering
* Purges all service instances
* Purges all application bindings
* Deletes the service broker from the Cloud Controller

When an operator chooses to delete the Pivotal MySQL product, Ops Manager first
runs the **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete errand, then deletes the product.

Pre-delete errands run by default. An operator can prevent a pre-delete errand from running by setting its [run rule](#run-rules) to **Off** under **Pending Changes** in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard or on the product tile's **Settings** tab **Errands** pane, before installing the product.

##<a id='run-rules'></a>Errand Run Rules

Some errands do not always need to run. For example, installing a minor patch to a existing service might not require re-registering its broker. Ops Manager lets operators save installation time by turning errands off or on. They set these errand run rules in two places:

* **One-Time Rules** under **Pending Changes** in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. These rules only apply to the next time you run **Apply Changes** and do not persist after the next successful installation.

* **Persistent Rules** in the tile's **Errands** pane. These rules persist through subsequent installations, until changed in the **Errands** pane.
